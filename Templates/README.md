# Streamlined fGDB and hosted Feature layer templates 

What can you do with the INSPIRE Esri GDB Alternative Encodings? Templates are a way to make creating streamlined INSPIRE data easier. We have created a handful of templates to set the pattern. This repository welcomes you to contribute additional templates to this ...

In the spirit of making things easier, let's share templates that put the Alternative Encodings into action. We've set the pattern by creating file Geodatabse (fGDB) and ArcGIS Online hosted Feature layer templates. Instructions for how to access and use these free templates are provided below.

*Note: Creating streamlined INSPIRE data using hosted Feature layer templates requires an ArcGIS Online account.

## Streamlined templates 

Once Alternative Encoding rules are in place, we create the Esri GDB (fGDB) and hosted Feature layer templates based on these rules.
