# Streamlined fGDB and hosted Feature layer templates 

What can you do with the INSPIRE Esri GDB Alternative Encodings? First, create streamlined INSPIRE data using templates! Streamlined INSPIRE templates are a way to make creating INSPIRE data easier. They give you a well-structured container (or "target" dataset) into which you can load your source data.

We have created a handful of templates to help get you started. This repository welcomes contributions of GDB templates on additional INSPIRE themes, model transformation rules, and appropriate model GDB encoding documentation.

Templates put the Alternative Encodings into action. Following the [Model Transformation rules](https://github.com/ArcGIS/Inspire_Open_Data/tree/main/model-transformations) and ['INSPIRE Geodatabase Encoding' rules](https://github.com/ArcGIS/Inspire_Open_Data/tree/main/gdb-encoding), we created Esri GDB (fGDB) and hosted Feature layer templates. Follow the links below for instructions to access and use these free templates.
