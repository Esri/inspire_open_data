# Streamlined fGDB and hosted Feature layer templates 

What can you do with the INSPIRE Esri GDB Alternative Encodings? Create streamlined INSPIRE data using templates! Streamlined INSPIRE templates are a way to make creating INSPIRE data easier. They give you a well structured container (or "target" dataset) into which you can load your source data.

We have created a handful of templates to help get you started. This repository welcomes contributions of additional templates following the model transformation rules.

Templates put the Alternative Encodings into action. Following the [Model Transformation rules](https://github.com/ArcGIS/Inspire_Open_Data/tree/main/model-transformations) and ['INSPIRE Geodatabase Encoding' rules](https://github.com/ArcGIS/Inspire_Open_Data/tree/main/gdb-encoding), we created Esri GDB (fGDB) and hosted Feature layer templates. Follow the links below for instructions to access and use these free templates.
