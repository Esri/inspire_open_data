# Streamlined fGDB and hosted Feature layer templates 

What can you do with the INSPIRE Esri GDB Alternative Encodings? Create streamlined INSPIRE data with these templates! Streamlined INSPIRE templates are a way to make creating INSPIRE data easier. They give you a well structured container (or "target" dataset) into which you can load your source data.

We have created a handful of templates to help get you started. This repository welcomes contributions of additional templates following the model transformation rules.

Templates put the Alternative Encodings into action. Following the 'INSPIRE Esri GDB - Alternative Encoding' rules, we've created the Esri GDB (fGDB) and hosted Feature layer templates based on these rules. We've set the pattern by creating file Geodatabse (fGDB) and ArcGIS Online hosted Feature layer templates. Follow the links below for instructions to access and use these free templates.
